# ðŸ’» Meal Calorie Frontend

This repository contains the frontend client application, a modern, responsive web application designed for tracking and calculating meal calorie and nutrient content. It communicates with the Meal Calorie REST API (provided separately) to handle authentication and fetch food data from the USDA FoodData Central.

## Key Features

* **Authentication Flow:** Complete **Register**, **Login**, and **Protected Routing** implemented using Next.js Middleware and custom authentication hooks (`useAuth.ts`).
* **Meal Search & Calculation:**
    * **Debounced Search:** Uses a debounced input to query the backend API efficiently for food items.
    * **Calorie Details:** Displays comprehensive calorie, macronutrient, and micronutrient information based on user-specified servings.
* **Persistent State:** Utilizes **Zustand** for global state management of authentication (`authStore.ts`) and food search results/details (`foodStore.ts`).
* **User Interface:**
    * **Theme Toggle:** Supports Light/Dark mode using `next-themes`.
    * **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop viewports.
* **History Tracking:** A dedicated **History page** displays a reversed list of previously searched and calculated meals using `userStore`.
